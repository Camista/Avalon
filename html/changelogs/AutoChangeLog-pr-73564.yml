changes:
  - bugfix: "Unregistered paywall firing pins wont vanish when you try to insert them into a gun"
  - bugfix: "Declining to pay for a paywall firing pin will no longer brick the firing pin for everyone"
  - bugfix: "paywall firing pins are linked to bank accounts instead of unique users, so they can't be used for overly elaborate ling checks or letting people without IDs fire them for free."
  - bugfix: "Attempting to fire an empty gun with a paywall firing pin will no longer charge you."
  - bugfix: "Multi-shot paywall firing pins do not charge you for agreeing to the initial prompt."
  - spellcheck: "Fixes a spelling mistake in paywall firing pin prompts"
  - code_imp: "The owner of a paywall firing pin is now tracked via account rather than ID, this stops the pin from holding a reference to a deleted ID if the ID is ever destroyed."
